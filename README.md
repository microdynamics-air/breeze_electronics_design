# breeze_electronics_design

## Description
This project is created and managed by EDA softwares, which contains the breeze quadcopter's component library, footprint library, schematic, printed circuit boards, etc.

## Note
Because of the changes in the project's requirements, we decided to use **Altium Designer** as the tool for developing the first edition of PCB rather than **KiCad**! So if you want to find the latest PCB design documents, please visit the **altium** directory.
